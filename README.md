<h1> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OrianeORDS </h1>

<p>
After <b>nearly 10 years as a project manager in the higher education field</b>, I am now pursuing a career as a business application developer. I recently gained solid coding knowledge through a <b>self-taught full-stack developer bootcamp</b> (using JavaScript tools such as Node.js, EJS, and React.js).  
I am thrilled to continue this learning journey as <b>an apprentice at Wild Code School</b>.  
Structured, persistent, and creative, I am also known for my empathy and teamwork skills. I am currently seeking a company with a strong learning environment where collective intelligence thrives.

  **Description**: A React-based digital art gallery that integrates the MET Museum's API to showcase its vast collection of art.  
  **The team**: A group of 3 developers working across different time zones.  
  **My role**: I created the SearchBar component and its functionalities based on a Figma design template. I also learned how to use Redux to manage the data fetched through the API.
  **Timing**: Currently under development.
