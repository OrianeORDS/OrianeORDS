<h1> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OrianeORDS </h1>

<p>
After <b>nearly 10 years as a project manager in the higher education field</b>, I am now pursuing a career as a business application developer. I recently gained solid coding knowledge through a <b>self-taught full-stack developer bootcamp</b> (using JavaScript tools such as Node.js, EJS, and React.js).  
I am thrilled to continue this learning journey as <b>an apprentice at Wild Code School</b>.  
Structured, persistent, and creative, I am also known for my empathy and teamwork skills. I am currently seeking a company with a strong learning environment where collective intelligence thrives.
